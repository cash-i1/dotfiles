## Installation 
_Linux only_

It works with almost all markdown flavours (the below blank line matters).

1. Make sure python is installed
2. Download `install.py` ([here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cash-i1/dotfiles/main/install.py))
3. Run it and it should backup your directories and replace them with the new ones
