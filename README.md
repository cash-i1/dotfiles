# dotfiles
This github repo has all of my dotfiles.

> _Also my nvim config is probably sub optimal._

**also i remade everything from scratch so it should work**

## Notes
- You might need to download some stuff for all the configs to work. this is a list of the ones i can think of right now:
    - ripgrep (for telescope live grep search in nvim)
    - JetBrains mono bold and extra bold (for kitty, you might need to change the settings to use the right font you downloaded which should be listed in the `kitty +list-fonts` command)


## Installation 
_Linux only_

> [!CAUTION]
> **This python script is pretty bad so run it at your own risk!**
(also it doesnt even work for now)

1. Make sure python is installed
2. Download `install.py` ([here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cash-i1/dotfiles/main/install.py))
3. Run it and it should backup your directories and replace them with the new ones
